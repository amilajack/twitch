// Given a string s and an array of words, find that longest word 
// that's a substring of s

// Word w is a subsequence of s if some number of characters, possibly 
// zero, can be deleted from s to form s, without 
// reordering the remaining characters.

// s = "abppplee" and 
// words = {"able", "ale", "apple", "bale", "kangaroo"} 
// the correct output would be "apple"
